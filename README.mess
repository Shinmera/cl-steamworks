## About cl-steamworks
This is a wrapper library to allow you to interface with the Valve SteamWorks API.

## Setup
This library does //not// ship the SteamWorks and SteamClient binaries. You must get your own copy from "Valve"(https://partner.steamgames.com/). Once you have the SDK, load ``cl-steamworks-generator`` and run the ``setup`` function.
